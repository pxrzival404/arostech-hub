# Git Workflow

## Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <description>

<optional body>
```

Types: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, perf, ci

Note: To disable co-author attribution on commits, set `"includeCoAuthoredBy": false` in `<harness-home>/settings.json` (Claude Code appends `Co-Authored-By` by default; ECC does not ship this setting).

## Pull Request Workflow

When creating PRs:
1. Analyze full commit history (not just latest commit)
2. Use `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to see all changes
3. Draft comprehensive PR summary
4. Include test plan with TODOs
5. Push with `-u` flag if new branch

> For the full development process (planning, TDD, code review) before git operations,
> see [`0xrizz-workflow.md`](file:///d:/dev/arostech-hub/docs/engineering/governance/0xrizz-workflow.md#L1-L100).
